  The possibility for the {controller|index:controller} or {processor|index:processor}
  to use standard data-protection clauses adopted by the Commission or by a {supervisory
  authority|index:supervisory-authority} should prevent controllers or processors
  neither from including the standard data-protection clauses in a wider contract,
  such as a contract between the {processor|index:processor} and another {processor|index:processor},
  nor from adding other clauses or additional safeguards provided that they do not
  contradict, directly or indirectly, the standard contractual clauses adopted by
  the Commission or by a {supervisory authority|index:supervisory-authority} or prejudice
  the fundamental rights or freedoms of the data subjects. Controllers and processors
  should be encouraged to provide additional safeguards via contractual commitments
  that supplement standard protection clauses.
