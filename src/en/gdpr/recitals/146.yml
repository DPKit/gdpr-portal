  The {controller|index:controller} or {processor|index:processor} should compensate
  any damage which a person may suffer as a result of {processing|index:processing}
  that infringes this {Regulation|index:regulation}. The {controller|index:controller}
  or {processor|index:processor} should be exempt from liability if it proves that
  it is not in any way responsible for the damage. The concept of damage should be
  broadly interpreted in the light of the case-law of the Court of Justice in a manner
  which fully reflects the objectives of this {Regulation|index:regulation}. This
  is without prejudice to any claims for damage deriving from the violation of other
  rules in Union or Member State law. {Processing|index:processing} that infringes
  this {Regulation|index:regulation} also includes {processing|index:processing} that
  infringes delegated and implementing acts adopted in accordance with this {Regulation|index:regulation}
  and Member State law specifying rules of this {Regulation|index:regulation}. Data
  subjects should receive full and effective compensation for the damage they have
  suffered. Where controllers or processors are involved in the same {processing|index:processing},
  each {controller|index:controller} or {processor|index:processor} should be held
  liable for the entire damage. However, where they are joined to the same judicial
  proceedings, in accordance with Member State law, compensation may be apportioned
  according to the responsibility of each {controller|index:controller} or {processor|index:processor}
  for the damage caused by the {processing|index:processing}, provided that full and
  effective compensation of the {data subject|index:data-subject} who suffered the
  damage is ensured. Any {controller|index:controller} or {processor|index:processor}
  which has paid full compensation may subsequently institute recourse proceedings
  against other controllers or processors involved in the same {processing|index:processing}.
