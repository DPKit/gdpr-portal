  The {processing|index:processing} of {personal data|index:personal-data} of data
  subjects who are in the Union by a {controller|index:controller} or {processor|index:processor}
  not established in the Union should also be subject to this {Regulation|index:regulation}
  when it is related to the monitoring of the behaviour of such data subjects in so
  far as their behaviour takes place within the Union. In order to determine whether
  a {processing|index:processing} activity can be considered to monitor the behaviour
  of data subjects, it should be ascertained whether {natural persons|index:natural-person}
  are tracked on the internet including potential subsequent use of {personal data|index:personal-data}
  {processing|index:processing} techniques which consist of {profiling|index:profiling}
  a {natural person|index:natural-person}, particularly in order to take decisions
  concerning her or him or for analysing or predicting her or his personal preferences,
  behaviours and attitudes.
