  This {Regulation|index:regulation} allows the principle of public access to official
  documents to be taken into account when applying this {Regulation|index:regulation}.
  Public access to official documents may be considered to be in the public interest.
  {Personal data|index:personal-data} in documents held by a public authority or a
  public body should be able to be publicly disclosed by that authority or body if
  the disclosure is provided for by Union or Member State law to which the public
  authority or public body is subject. Such laws should reconcile public access to
  official documents and the reuse of public sector information with the right to
  the protection of {personal data|index:personal-data} and may therefore provide
  for the necessary reconciliation with the right to the protection of {personal data|index:personal-data}
  pursuant to this {Regulation|index:regulation}. The reference to public authorities
  and bodies should in that context include all authorities or other bodies covered
  by Member State law on public access to documents. Directive 2003/98/EC of the European
  Parliament and of the Council (14) leaves intact and in no way affects the level
  of protection of {natural persons|index:natural-person} with regard to the {processing|index:processing}
  of {personal data|index:personal-data} under the provisions of Union and Member
  State law, and in particular does not alter the obligations and rights set out in
  this {Regulation|index:regulation}. In particular, that Directive should not apply
  to documents to which access is excluded or restricted by virtue of the access regimes
  on the grounds of protection of {personal data|index:personal-data}, and parts of
  documents accessible by virtue of those regimes which contain {personal data|index:personal-data}
  the re-use of which has been provided for by law as being incompatible with the
  law concerning the protection of {natural persons|index:natural-person} with regard
  to the {processing|index:processing} of {personal data|index:personal-data}.
