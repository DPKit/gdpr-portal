  This should in particular apply to large-scale {processing|index:processing} operations which aim to process a considerable amount of {personal data|index:personal-data} at regional, national or supranational level and which could affect a large number of data subjects and which are likely to result in a high risk, for example, on account of their sensitivity, where in accordance with the achieved state of technological knowledge a new technology is used on a large scale as well as to other {processing|index:processing} operations which result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, in particular where those operations render it more difficult for data subjects to exercise their rights. A data protection impact assessment should also be made where {personal data|index:personal-data} are processed for taking decisions regarding specific {natural persons|index:natural-person} following any systematic and extensive evaluation of personal aspects relating to {natural persons|index:natural-person} based on {profiling|index:profiling} those data or following the {processing|index:processing} of special categories of {personal data|index:personal-data}, {biometric data|index:biometric-data}, or data on criminal convictions and offences or related security measures. A data protection impact assessment is equally required for monitoring publicly accessible areas on a large scale, especially when using optic-electronic devices or for any other operations where the competent {supervisory authority|index:supervisory-authority} considers that the {processing|index:processing} is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, in particular because they prevent data subjects from exercising a right or using a service or a contract, or because they are carried out systematically on a large scale. The {processing|index:processing} of {personal data|index:personal-data} should not be considered to be on a large scale if the {processing|index:processing} concerns {personal data|index:personal-data} from patients or clients by an individual physician, other health care professional or lawyer. In such cases, a data protection impact assessment should not be mandatory.
