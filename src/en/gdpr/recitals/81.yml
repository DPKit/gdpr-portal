  To ensure compliance with the requirements of this {Regulation|index:regulation}
  in respect of the {processing|index:processing} to be carried out by the {processor|index:processor}
  on behalf of the {controller|index:controller}, when entrusting a {processor|index:processor}
  with {processing|index:processing} activities, the {controller|index:controller}
  should use only processors providing sufficient guarantees, in particular in terms
  of expert knowledge, reliability and resources, to implement {technical and organisational
  measures|index:technical-and-organisational-measures} which will meet the requirements
  of this {Regulation|index:regulation}, including for the security of {processing|index:processing}.
  The adherence of the {processor|index:processor} to an approved code of conduct
  or an approved certification mechanism may be used as an element to demonstrate
  compliance with the obligations of the {controller|index:controller}. The carrying-out
  of {processing|index:processing} by a {processor|index:processor} should be governed
  by a contract or other legal act under Union or Member State law, binding the {processor|index:processor}
  to the {controller|index:controller}, setting out the subject-matter and duration
  of the {processing|index:processing}, the nature and purposes of the {processing|index:processing},
  the type of {personal data|index:personal-data} and categories of data subjects,
  taking into account the specific tasks and responsibilities of the {processor|index:processor}
  in the context of the {processing|index:processing} to be carried out and the risk
  to the rights and freedoms of the {data subject|index:data-subject}. The {controller|index:controller}
  and {processor|index:processor} may choose to use an individual contract or standard
  contractual clauses which are adopted either directly by the Commission or by a
  {supervisory authority|index:supervisory-authority} in accordance with the consistency
  mechanism and then adopted by the Commission. After the completion of the {processing|index:processing}
  on behalf of the {controller|index:controller}, the {processor|index:processor}
  should, at the choice of the {controller|index:controller}, return or delete the
  {personal data|index:personal-data}, unless there is a requirement to store the
  {personal data|index:personal-data} under Union or Member State law to which the
  {processor|index:processor} is subject.
