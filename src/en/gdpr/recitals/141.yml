  Every {data subject|index:data-subject} should have the right to lodge a complaint
  with a single {supervisory authority|index:supervisory-authority}, in particular
  in the Member State of his or her habitual residence, and the right to an effective
  judicial remedy in accordance with Article 47 of the Charter if the {data subject|index:data-subject}
  considers that his or her rights under this {Regulation|index:regulation} are infringed
  or where the {supervisory authority|index:supervisory-authority} does not act on
  a complaint, partially or wholly rejects or dismisses a complaint or does not act
  where such action is necessary to protect the rights of the {data subject|index:data-subject}.
  The investigation following a complaint should be carried out, subject to judicial
  review, to the extent that is appropriate in the specific case. The {supervisory
  authority|index:supervisory-authority} should inform the {data subject|index:data-subject}
  of the progress and the outcome of the complaint within a reasonable period. If
  the case requires further investigation or coordination with another {supervisory
  authority|index:supervisory-authority}, intermediate information should be given
  to the {data subject|index:data-subject}. In order to facilitate the submission
  of complaints, each {supervisory authority|index:supervisory-authority} should take
  measures such as providing a complaint submission form which can also be completed
  electronically, without excluding other means of communication.
