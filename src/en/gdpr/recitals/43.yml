  In order to ensure that {consent|index:consent} is freely given, {consent|index:consent} should not provide a valid legal ground for the {processing|index:processing} of {personal data|index:personal-data} in a specific case where there is a clear imbalance between the {data subject|index:data-subject} and the {controller|index:controller}, in particular where the {controller|index:controller} is a public authority and it is therefore unlikely that {consent|index:consent} was freely given in all the circumstances of that specific situation. {Consent|index:consent} is presumed not to be freely given if it does not allow separate {consent|index:consent} to be given to different {personal data|index:personal-data} {processing|index:processing} operations despite it being appropriate in the individual case, or if the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is dependent on the {consent|index:consent} despite such {consent|index:consent} not being necessary for such performance.
