  \ Regarding the {processing|index:processing} of {personal data|index:personal-data}\
  \ for compliance with a legal obligation, for the performance of a task carried\

  \ law on data protection implementing Directive 95/46/EC, Member States have several\

  \ also provides a margin of manoeuvre for Member States to specify its rules, including\
  \ for the {processing|index:processing} of special categories of {personal data|index:personal-data}\
  \ (\u2018sensitive data\u2019). To that extent, this {Regulation|index:regulation}\
