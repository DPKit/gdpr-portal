  Flows of {personal data|index:personal-data} to and from countries outside the Union
  and international organisations are necessary for the expansion of international
  trade and international cooperation. The increase in such flows has raised new challenges
  and concerns with regard to the protection of {personal data|index:personal-data}.
  However, when {personal data|index:personal-data} are transferred from the Union
  to controllers, processors or other recipients in third countries or to international
  organisations, the level of protection of {natural persons|index:natural-person}
  ensured in the Union by this {Regulation|index:regulation} should not be undermined,
  including in cases of onward transfers of {personal data|index:personal-data} from
  the third country or {international organisation|index:international-organisation}
  to controllers, processors in the same or another third country or {international
  organisation|index:international-organisation}. In any event, transfers to third
  countries and international organisations may only be carried out in full compliance
  with this {Regulation|index:regulation}. A transfer could take place only if, subject
  to the other provisions of this {Regulation|index:regulation}, the conditions laid
  down in the provisions of this {Regulation|index:regulation} relating to the transfer
  of {personal data|index:personal-data} to third countries or international organisations
  are complied with by the {controller|index:controller} or {processor|index:processor}.
