  The legal systems of Denmark and Estonia do not allow for administrative fines as
  set out in this {Regulation|index:regulation}. The rules on administrative fines
  may be applied in such a manner that in Denmark the fine is imposed by competent
  national courts as a criminal penalty and in Estonia the fine is imposed by the
  {supervisory authority|index:supervisory-authority} in the framework of a misdemeanour
  procedure, provided that such an application of the rules in those Member States
  has an equivalent effect to administrative fines imposed by supervisory authorities.
  Therefore the competent national courts should take into account the recommendation
  by the {supervisory authority|index:supervisory-authority} initiating the fine.
  In any event, the fines imposed should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.
