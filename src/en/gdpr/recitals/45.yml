  Where {processing|index:processing} is carried out in accordance with a legal obligation to which the {controller|index:controller} is subject or where {processing|index:processing} is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority, the {processing|index:processing} should have a basis in Union or Member State law. This {Regulation|index:regulation} does not require a specific law for each individual {processing|index:processing}. A law as a basis for several {processing|index:processing} operations based on a legal obligation to which the {controller|index:controller} is subject or where {processing|index:processing} is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of an official authority may be sufficient. It should also be for Union or Member State law to determine the purpose of {processing|index:processing}. Furthermore, that law could specify the general conditions of this {Regulation|index:regulation} governing the lawfulness of {personal data|index:personal-data} {processing|index:processing}, establish specifications for determining the {controller|index:controller}, the type of {personal data|index:personal-data} which are subject to the {processing|index:processing}, the data subjects concerned, the entities to which the {personal data|index:personal-data} may be disclosed, the purpose limitations, the storage period and other measures to ensure lawful and fair {processing|index:processing}. It should also be for Union or Member State law to determine whether the {controller|index:controller} performing a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority should be a public authority or another natural or legal person governed by public law, or, where it is in the public interest to do so, including for health purposes such as public health and social protection and the management of health care services, by private law, such as a professional association.
