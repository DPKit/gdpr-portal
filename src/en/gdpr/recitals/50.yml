  The {processing|index:processing} of {personal data|index:personal-data} for purposes other than those for which the {personal data|index:personal-data} were initially collected should be allowed only where the {processing|index:processing} is compatible with the purposes for which the {personal data|index:personal-data} were initially collected. In such a case, no legal basis separate from that which allowed the collection of the {personal data|index:personal-data} is required. If the {processing|index:processing} is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the {controller|index:controller}, Union or Member State law may determine and specify the tasks and purposes for which the further {processing|index:processing} should be regarded as compatible and lawful. Further {processing|index:processing} for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes should be considered to be compatible lawful {processing|index:processing} operations. The legal basis provided by Union or Member State law for the {processing|index:processing} of {personal data|index:personal-data} may also provide a legal basis for further {processing|index:processing}. In order to ascertain whether a purpose of further {processing|index:processing} is compatible with the purpose for which the {personal data|index:personal-data} are initially collected, the {controller|index:controller}, after having met all the requirements for the lawfulness of the original {processing|index:processing}, should take into account, inter alia: any link between those purposes and the purposes of the intended further {processing|index:processing}; the context in which the {personal data|index:personal-data} have been collected, in particular the reasonable expectations of data subjects based on their relationship with the {controller|index:controller} as to their further use; the nature of the {personal data|index:personal-data}; the consequences of the intended further {processing|index:processing} for data subjects; and the existence of appropriate safeguards in both the original and intended further {processing|index:processing} operations. Where the {data subject|index:data-subject} has given {consent|index:consent} or the {processing|index:processing} is based on Union or Member State law which constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard, in particular, important objectives of general public interest, the {controller|index:controller} should be allowed to further process the {personal data|index:personal-data} irrespective of the compatibility of the purposes. In any case, the application of the principles set out in this {Regulation|index:regulation} and in particular the information of the {data subject|index:data-subject} on those other purposes and on his or her rights including the right to object, should be ensured. Indicating possible criminal acts or threats to public security by the {controller|index:controller} and transmitting the relevant {personal data|index:personal-data} in individual cases or in several cases relating to the same criminal act or threats to public security to a competent authority should be regarded as being in the legitimate interest pursued by the {controller|index:controller}. However, such transmission in the legitimate interest of the {controller|index:controller} or further {processing|index:processing} of {personal data|index:personal-data} should be prohibited if the {processing|index:processing} is not compatible with a legal, professional or other binding obligation of secrecy.
