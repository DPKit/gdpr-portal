  To further strengthen the control over his or her own data, where the {processing|index:processing}
  of {personal data|index:personal-data} is carried out by {automated means|index:automated-means},
  the {data subject|index:data-subject} should also be allowed to receive {personal
  data|index:personal-data} concerning him or her which he or she has provided to
  a {controller|index:controller} in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable
  and interoperable format, and to transmit it to another {controller|index:controller}.
  Data controllers should be encouraged to develop interoperable formats that enable
  data portability. That right should apply where the {data subject|index:data-subject}
  provided the {personal data|index:personal-data} on the basis of his or her {consent|index:consent}
  or the {processing|index:processing} is necessary for the performance of a contract.
  It should not apply where {processing|index:processing} is based on a legal ground
  other than {consent|index:consent} or contract. By its very nature, that right should
  not be exercised against controllers {processing|index:processing} {personal data|index:personal-data}
  in the exercise of their public duties. It should therefore not apply where the
  {processing|index:processing} of the {personal data|index:personal-data} is necessary
  for compliance with a legal obligation to which the {controller|index:controller}
  is subject or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or
  in the exercise of an official authority vested in the {controller|index:controller}.
  The data subject's right to transmit or receive {personal data|index:personal-data}
  concerning him or her should not create an obligation for the controllers to adopt
  or maintain {processing|index:processing} systems which are technically compatible.
  Where, in a certain set of {personal data|index:personal-data}, more than one {data
  subject|index:data-subject} is concerned, the right to receive the {personal data|index:personal-data}
  should be without prejudice to the rights and freedoms of other data subjects in
  accordance with this {Regulation|index:regulation}. Furthermore, that right should
  not prejudice the right of the {data subject|index:data-subject} to obtain the erasure
  of {personal data|index:personal-data} and the limitations of that right as set
  out in this {Regulation|index:regulation} and should, in particular, not imply the
  erasure of {personal data|index:personal-data} concerning the {data subject|index:data-subject}
  which have been provided by him or her for the performance of a contract to the
  extent that and for as long as the {personal data|index:personal-data} are necessary
  for the performance of that contract. Where technically feasible, the {data subject|index:data-subject}
  should have the right to have the {personal data|index:personal-data} transmitted
  directly from one {controller|index:controller} to another.
