  The principles of fair and transparent {processing|index:processing} require that the {data subject|index:data-subject} be informed of the existence of the {processing|index:processing} operation and its purposes. The {controller|index:controller} should provide the {data subject|index:data-subject} with any further information necessary to ensure fair and transparent {processing|index:processing} taking into account the specific circumstances and context in which the {personal data|index:personal-data} are processed. Furthermore, the {data subject|index:data-subject} should be informed of the existence of {profiling|index:profiling} and the consequences of such {profiling|index:profiling}. Where the {personal data|index:personal-data} are collected from the {data subject|index:data-subject}, the {data subject|index:data-subject} should also be informed whether he or she is obliged to provide the {personal data|index:personal-data} and of the consequences, where he or she does not provide such data. That information may be provided in combination with standardised icons in order to give in an easily visible, intelligible and clearly legible manner, a meaningful overview of the intended {processing|index:processing}. Where the icons are presented electronically, they should be machine-readable.
