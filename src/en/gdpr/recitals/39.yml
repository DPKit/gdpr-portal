  Any {processing|index:processing} of {personal data|index:personal-data} should be lawful and fair. It should be transparent to {natural persons|index:natural-person} that {personal data|index:personal-data} concerning them are collected, used, consulted or otherwise processed and to what extent the {personal data|index:personal-data} are or will be processed. The principle of transparency requires that any information and communication relating to the {processing|index:processing} of those {personal data|index:personal-data} be easily accessible and easy to understand, and that clear and plain language be used. That principle concerns, in particular, information to the data subjects on the identity of the {controller|index:controller} and the purposes of the {processing|index:processing} and further information to ensure fair and transparent {processing|index:processing} in respect of the {natural persons|index:natural-person} concerned and their right to obtain confirmation and communication of {personal data|index:personal-data} concerning them which are being processed. {Natural persons|index:natural-person} should be made aware of risks, rules, safeguards and rights in relation to the {processing|index:processing} of {personal data|index:personal-data} and how to exercise their rights in relation to such {processing|index:processing}. In particular, the specific purposes for which {personal data|index:personal-data} are processed should be explicit and legitimate and determined at the time of the collection of the {personal data|index:personal-data}. The {personal data|index:personal-data} should be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which they are processed. This requires, in particular, ensuring that the period for which the {personal data|index:personal-data} are stored is limited to a strict minimum. {Personal data|index:personal-data} should be processed only if the purpose of the {processing|index:processing} could not reasonably be fulfilled by other means. In order to ensure that the {personal data|index:personal-data} are not kept longer than necessary, time limits should be established by the {controller|index:controller} for erasure or for a periodic review. Every reasonable step should be taken to ensure that {personal data|index:personal-data} which are inaccurate are rectified or deleted. {Personal data|index:personal-data} should be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security and confidentiality of the {personal data|index:personal-data}, including for preventing unauthorised access to or use of {personal data|index:personal-data} and the equipment used for the {processing|index:processing}.
