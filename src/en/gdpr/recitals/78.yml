  with regard to the {processing|index:processing} of {personal data|index:personal-data}
  require that appropriate {technical and organisational measures|index:technical-and-organisational-measures}
  be taken to ensure that the requirements of this {Regulation|index:regulation} are
  met. In order to be able to demonstrate compliance with this {Regulation|index:regulation},
  the {controller|index:controller} should adopt internal policies and implement measures
  which meet in particular the principles of data protection by design and data protection
  by default. Such measures could consist, inter alia, of minimising the {processing|index:processing}
  of {personal data|index:personal-data}, pseudonymising {personal data|index:personal-data}
  as soon as possible, transparency with regard to the functions and {processing|index:processing}
  of {personal data|index:personal-data}, enabling the {data subject|index:data-subject}
  to monitor the data {processing|index:processing}, enabling the {controller|index:controller}
  to create and improve security features. When developing, designing, selecting and
  using applications, services and products that are based on the {processing|index:processing}
  of {personal data|index:personal-data} or process {personal data|index:personal-data}
  to fulfil their task, producers of the products, services and applications should
  be encouraged to take into account the right to data protection when developing
  and designing such products, services and applications and, with due regard to the
  state of the art, to make sure that controllers and processors are able to fulfil
  their data protection obligations. The principles of data protection by design and
  by default should also be taken into consideration in the context of public tenders.
