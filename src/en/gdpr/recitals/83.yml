  In order to maintain security and to prevent {processing|index:processing} in infringement
  of this {Regulation|index:regulation}, the {controller|index:controller} or {processor|index:processor}
  should evaluate the risks inherent in the {processing|index:processing} and implement
  measures to mitigate those risks, such as encryption. Those measures should ensure
  an appropriate level of security, including confidentiality, taking into account
  the state of the art and the costs of implementation in relation to the risks and
  the nature of the {personal data|index:personal-data} to be protected. In assessing
  data security risk, consideration should be given to the risks that are presented
  by {personal data|index:personal-data} {processing|index:processing}, such as accidental
  or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access
  to, {personal data|index:personal-data} transmitted, stored or otherwise processed
  which may in particular lead to physical, material or non-material damage.
