  Where {processing|index:processing} is based on the data subject's {consent|index:consent},
  the {controller|index:controller} should be able to demonstrate that the {data subject|index:data-subject}
  has given {consent|index:consent} to the {processing|index:processing} operation.
  In particular in the context of a written declaration on another matter, safeguards
  should ensure that the {data subject|index:data-subject} is aware of the fact that
  and the extent to which {consent|index:consent} is given. In accordance with Council
  Directive 93/13/EEC (10) a declaration of {consent|index:consent} pre-formulated
  by the {controller|index:controller} should be provided in an intelligible and easily
  accessible form, using clear and plain language and it should not contain unfair
  terms. For {consent|index:consent} to be informed, the {data subject|index:data-subject}
  should be aware at least of the identity of the {controller|index:controller} and
  the purposes of the {processing|index:processing} for which the {personal data|index:personal-data}
  are intended. {Consent|index:consent} should not be regarded as freely given if
  the {data subject|index:data-subject} has no genuine or free choice or is unable
  to refuse or withdraw {consent|index:consent} without detriment.
