  The objectives and principles of Directive 95/46/EC remain sound, but it has not prevented fragmentation in the implementation of data protection across the Union, legal uncertainty or a widespread public perception that there are significant risks to the protection of {natural persons|index:natural-person}, in particular with regard to online activity. Differences in the level of protection of the rights and freedoms of {natural persons|index:natural-person}, in particular the right to the protection of {personal data|index:personal-data}, with regard to the {processing|index:processing} of {personal data|index:personal-data} in the Member States may prevent the free flow of {personal data|index:personal-data} throughout the Union. Those differences may therefore constitute an obstacle to the pursuit of economic activities at the level of the Union, distort competition and impede authorities in the discharge of their responsibilities under Union law. Such a difference in levels of protection is due to the existence of differences in the implementation and application of Directive 95/46/EC.
