  In order to ensure consistent monitoring and enforcement of this {Regulation|index:regulation}
  throughout the Union, the supervisory authorities should have in each Member State
  the same tasks and effective powers, including powers of investigation, corrective
  powers and sanctions, and authorisation and advisory powers, in particular in cases
  of complaints from {natural persons|index:natural-person}, and without prejudice
  to the powers of prosecutorial authorities under Member State law, to bring infringements
  of this {Regulation|index:regulation} to the attention of the judicial authorities
  and engage in legal proceedings. Such powers should also include the power to impose
  a temporary or definitive limitation, including a ban, on {processing|index:processing}.
  Member States may specify other tasks related to the protection of {personal data|index:personal-data}
  under this {Regulation|index:regulation}. The powers of supervisory authorities
  should be exercised in accordance with appropriate procedural safeguards set out
  in Union and Member State law, impartially, fairly and within a reasonable time.
  In particular each measure should be appropriate, necessary and proportionate in
  view of ensuring compliance with this {Regulation|index:regulation}, taking into
  account the circumstances of each individual case, respect the right of every person
  to be heard before any individual measure which would affect him or her adversely
  is taken and avoid superfluous costs and excessive inconveniences for the persons
  concerned. Investigatory powers as regards access to premises should be exercised
  in accordance with specific requirements in Member State procedural law, such as
  the requirement to obtain a prior judicial authorisation. Each legally binding measure
  of the {supervisory authority|index:supervisory-authority} should be in writing,
  be clear and unambiguous, indicate the {supervisory authority|index:supervisory-authority}
  which has issued the measure, the date of issue of the measure, bear the signature
  of the head, or a member of the {supervisory authority|index:supervisory-authority}
  authorised by him or her, give the reasons for the measure, and refer to the right
  of an effective remedy. This should not preclude additional requirements pursuant
  to Member State procedural law. The adoption of a legally binding decision implies
  that it may give rise to judicial review in the Member State of the {supervisory
  authority|index:supervisory-authority} that adopted the decision.
