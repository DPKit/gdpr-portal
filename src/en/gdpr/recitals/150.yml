  In order to strengthen and harmonise administrative penalties for infringements of this {Regulation|index:regulation}, each {supervisory authority|index:supervisory-authority} should have the power to impose administrative fines. This {Regulation|index:regulation} should indicate infringements and the upper limit and criteria for setting the related administrative fines, which should be determined by the competent {supervisory authority|index:supervisory-authority} in each individual case, taking into account all relevant circumstances of the specific situation, with due regard in particular to the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement and of its consequences and the measures taken to ensure compliance with the obligations under this {Regulation|index:regulation} and to prevent or mitigate the consequences of the infringement. Where administrative fines are imposed on an undertaking, an undertaking should be understood to be an undertaking in accordance with Articles 101 and 102 TFEU for those purposes. Where administrative fines are imposed on persons that are not an undertaking, the {supervisory authority|index:supervisory-authority} should take account of the general level of income in the Member State as well as the economic situation of the person in considering the appropriate amount of the fine. The consistency mechanism may also be used to promote a consistent application of administrative fines. It should be for the Member States to determine whether and to which extent public authorities should be subject to administrative fines. Imposing an administrative fine or giving a warning does not affect the application of other powers of the supervisory authorities or of other penalties under this {Regulation|index:regulation}.
