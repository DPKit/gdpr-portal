  The protection of {natural persons|index:natural-person} with regard to the {processing|index:processing}
  of {personal data|index:personal-data} by competent authorities for the purposes
  of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences
  or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the
  prevention of threats to public security and the free movement of such data, is
  the subject of a specific Union legal act. This {Regulation|index:regulation} should
  not, therefore, apply to {processing|index:processing} activities for those purposes.
  However, {personal data|index:personal-data} processed by public authorities under
  this {Regulation|index:regulation} should, when used for those purposes, be governed
  by a more specific Union legal act, namely Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European
  Parliament and of the Council (7). Member States may entrust competent authorities
  within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/680 with tasks which are not necessarily
  carried out for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution
  of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding
  against and prevention of threats to public security, so that the {processing|index:processing}
  of {personal data|index:personal-data} for those other purposes, in so far as it
  is within the scope of Union law, falls within the scope of this {Regulation|index:regulation}.
  With regard to the {processing|index:processing} of {personal data|index:personal-data}
  by those competent authorities for purposes falling within scope of this {Regulation|index:regulation},
  Member States should be able to maintain or introduce more specific provisions to
  adapt the application of the rules of this {Regulation|index:regulation}. Such provisions
  may determine more precisely specific requirements for the {processing|index:processing}
  of {personal data|index:personal-data} by those competent authorities for those
  other purposes, taking into account the constitutional, organisational and administrative
  structure of the respective Member State. When the {processing|index:processing}
  of {personal data|index:personal-data} by private bodies falls within the scope
  of this {Regulation|index:regulation}, this {Regulation|index:regulation} should
  provide for the possibility for Member States under specific conditions to restrict
  by law certain obligations and rights when such a restriction constitutes a necessary
  and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard specific important
  interests including public security and the prevention, investigation, detection
  or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including
  the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security. This
  is relevant for instance in the framework of anti-money laundering or the activities
  of forensic laboratories.
