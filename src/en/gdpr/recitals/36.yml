  The main establishment of a {controller|index:controller} in the Union should be
  the place of its central administration in the Union, unless the decisions on the
  purposes and means of the {processing|index:processing} of {personal data|index:personal-data}
  are taken in another establishment of the {controller|index:controller} in the Union,
  in which case that other establishment should be considered to be the main establishment.
  The main establishment of a {controller|index:controller} in the Union should be
  determined according to objective criteria and should imply the effective and real
  exercise of management activities determining the main decisions as to the purposes
  and means of {processing|index:processing} through stable arrangements. That criterion
  should not depend on whether the {processing|index:processing} of {personal data|index:personal-data}
  is carried out at that location. The presence and use of technical means and technologies
  for {processing|index:processing} {personal data|index:personal-data} or {processing|index:processing}
  activities do not, in themselves, constitute a main establishment and are therefore
  not determining criteria for a main establishment. The main establishment of the
  {processor|index:processor} should be the place of its central administration in
  the Union or, if it has no central administration in the Union, the place where
  the main {processing|index:processing} activities take place in the Union. In cases
  involving both the {controller|index:controller} and the {processor|index:processor},
  the competent lead {supervisory authority|index:supervisory-authority} should remain
  the {supervisory authority|index:supervisory-authority} of the Member State where
  the {controller|index:controller} has its main establishment, but the {supervisory
  authority|index:supervisory-authority} of the {processor|index:processor} should
  be considered to be a {supervisory authority|index:supervisory-authority} concerned
  and that {supervisory authority|index:supervisory-authority} should participate
  in the cooperation procedure provided for by this {Regulation|index:regulation}.
  In any case, the supervisory authorities of the Member State or Member States where
  the {processor|index:processor} has one or more establishments should not be considered
  to be supervisory authorities concerned where the draft decision concerns only the
  {controller|index:controller}. Where the {processing|index:processing} is carried
  out by a {group of undertakings|index:group-of-undertakings}, the main establishment
  of the controlling undertaking should be considered to be the main establishment
  of the {group of undertakings|index:group-of-undertakings}, except where the purposes
  and means of {processing|index:processing} are determined by another undertaking.
