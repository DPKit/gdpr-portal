  The {controller|index:controller} should communicate to the {data subject|index:data-subject}
  a {personal data|index:personal-data} breach, without undue delay, where that {personal
  data|index:personal-data} breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights
  and freedoms of the {natural person|index:natural-person} in order to allow him
  or her to take the necessary precautions. The communication should describe the
  nature of the {personal data|index:personal-data} breach as well as recommendations
  for the {natural person|index:natural-person} concerned to mitigate potential adverse
  effects. Such communications to data subjects should be made as soon as reasonably
  feasible and in close cooperation with the {supervisory authority|index:supervisory-authority},
  respecting guidance provided by it or by other relevant authorities such as law-enforcement
  authorities. For example, the need to mitigate an immediate risk of damage would
  call for prompt communication with data subjects whereas the need to implement appropriate
  measures against continuing or similar {personal data|index:personal-data} breaches
  may justify more time for communication.
