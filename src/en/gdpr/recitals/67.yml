  Methods by which to restrict the {processing|index:processing} of {personal data|index:personal-data}
  could include, inter alia, temporarily moving the selected data to another {processing|index:processing}
  system, making the selected {personal data|index:personal-data} unavailable to users,
  or temporarily removing published data from a website. In automated filing systems,
  the {restriction of processing|index:restriction-of-processing} should in principle
  be ensured by technical means in such a manner that the {personal data|index:personal-data}
  are not subject to further {processing|index:processing} operations and cannot be
  changed. The fact that the {processing|index:processing} of {personal data|index:personal-data}
  is restricted should be clearly indicated in the system.
