  The legitimate interests of a {controller|index:controller}, including those of
  a {controller|index:controller} to which the {personal data|index:personal-data}
  may be disclosed, or of a {third party|index:third-party}, may provide a legal basis
  for {processing|index:processing}, provided that the interests or the fundamental
  rights and freedoms of the {data subject|index:data-subject} are not overriding,
  taking into consideration the reasonable expectations of data subjects based on
  their relationship with the {controller|index:controller}. Such legitimate interest
  could exist for example where there is a relevant and appropriate relationship between
  the {data subject|index:data-subject} and the {controller|index:controller} in situations
  such as where the {data subject|index:data-subject} is a client or in the service
  of the {controller|index:controller}. At any rate the existence of a legitimate
  interest would need careful assessment including whether a {data subject|index:data-subject}
  can reasonably expect at the time and in the context of the collection of the {personal
  data|index:personal-data} that {processing|index:processing} for that purpose may
  take place. The interests and fundamental rights of the {data subject|index:data-subject}
  could in particular override the interest of the data {controller|index:controller}
  where {personal data|index:personal-data} are processed in circumstances where data
  subjects do not reasonably expect further {processing|index:processing}. Given that
  it is for the legislator to provide by law for the legal basis for public authorities
  to process {personal data|index:personal-data}, that legal basis should not apply
  to the {processing|index:processing} by public authorities in the performance of
  their tasks. The {processing|index:processing} of {personal data|index:personal-data}
  strictly necessary for the purposes of preventing fraud also constitutes a legitimate
  interest of the data {controller|index:controller} concerned. The {processing|index:processing}
  of {personal data|index:personal-data} for direct marketing purposes may be regarded
  as carried out for a legitimate interest.
