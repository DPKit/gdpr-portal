  Some third countries adopt laws, regulations and other legal acts which purport
  to directly regulate the {processing|index:processing} activities of natural and
  legal persons under the jurisdiction of the Member States. This may include judgments
  of courts or tribunals or decisions of administrative authorities in third countries
  requiring a {controller|index:controller} or {processor|index:processor} to transfer
  or disclose {personal data|index:personal-data}, and which are not based on an international
  agreement, such as a mutual legal assistance treaty, in force between the requesting
  third country and the Union or a Member State. The extraterritorial application
  of those laws, regulations and other legal acts may be in breach of international
  law and may impede the attainment of the protection of {natural persons|index:natural-person}
  ensured in the Union by this {Regulation|index:regulation}. Transfers should only
  be allowed where the conditions of this {Regulation|index:regulation} for a transfer
  to third countries are met. This may be the case, inter alia, where disclosure is
  necessary for an important ground of public interest recognised in Union or Member
  State law to which the {controller|index:controller} is subject.
