  Special categories of {personal data|index:personal-data} which merit higher protection
  should be processed for health-related purposes only where necessary to achieve
  those purposes for the benefit of {natural persons|index:natural-person} and society
  as a whole, in particular in the context of the management of health or social care
  services and systems, including {processing|index:processing} by the management
  and central national health authorities of such data for the purpose of quality
  control, management information and the general national and local supervision of
  the health or social care system, and ensuring continuity of health or social care
  and cross-border healthcare or health security, monitoring and alert purposes, or
  for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research
  purposes or statistical purposes, based on Union or Member State law which has to
  meet an objective of public interest, as well as for studies conducted in the public
  interest in the area of public health. Therefore, this {Regulation|index:regulation}
  should provide for harmonised conditions for the {processing|index:processing} of
  special categories of {personal data|index:personal-data} concerning health, in
  respect of specific needs, in particular where the {processing|index:processing}
  of such data is carried out for certain health-related purposes by persons subject
  to a legal obligation of professional secrecy. Union or Member State law should
  provide for specific and suitable measures so as to protect the fundamental rights
  and the {personal data|index:personal-data} of {natural persons|index:natural-person}.
  Member States should be allowed to maintain or introduce further conditions, including
  limitations, with regard to the {processing|index:processing} of {genetic data|index:genetic-data},
  {biometric data|index:biometric-data} or {data concerning health|index:data-concerning-health}.
  However, this should not hamper the free flow of {personal data|index:personal-data}
  within the Union when those conditions apply to {cross-border processing|index:cross-border-processing}
  of such data.
