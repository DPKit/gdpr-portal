  {Consent|index:consent} should be given by a clear affirmative act establishing a freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's agreement to the {processing|index:processing} of {personal data|index:personal-data} relating to him or her, such as by a written statement, including by electronic means, or an oral statement. This could include ticking a box when visiting an internet website, choosing technical settings for information society services or another statement or conduct which clearly indicates in this context the data subject's acceptance of the proposed {processing|index:processing} of his or her {personal data|index:personal-data}. Silence, pre-ticked boxes or inactivity should not therefore constitute {consent|index:consent}. {Consent|index:consent} should cover all {processing|index:processing} activities carried out for the same purpose or purposes. When the {processing|index:processing} has multiple purposes, {consent|index:consent} should be given for all of them. If the data subject's {consent|index:consent} is to be given following a request by electronic means, the request must be clear, concise and not unnecessarily disruptive to the use of the service for which it is provided.
