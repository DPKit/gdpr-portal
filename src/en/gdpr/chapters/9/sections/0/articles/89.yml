      {Processing|index:processing} for archiving purposes in the public interest,
      scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes, shall be
      subject to appropriate safeguards, in accordance with this {Regulation|index:regulation},
      for the rights and freedoms of the {data subject|index:data-subject}. Those
      safeguards shall ensure that {technical and organisational measures|index:technical-and-organisational-measures}
      are in place in particular in order to ensure respect for the principle of data
      minimisation. Those measures may include {pseudonymisation|index:pseudonymisation}
      provided that those purposes can be fulfilled in that manner. Where those purposes
      can be fulfilled by further {processing|index:processing} which does not permit
      or no longer permits the identification of data subjects, those purposes shall
      be fulfilled in that manner.
