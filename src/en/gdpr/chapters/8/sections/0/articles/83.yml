      Where the legal system of the Member State does not provide for administrative

      and have an equivalent effect to the administrative fines imposed by supervisory
      authorities. In any event, the fines imposed shall be effective, proportionate
      and dissuasive. Those Member States shall notify to the Commission the provisions
      of their laws which they adopt pursuant to this paragraph by 25 May 2018 and,
