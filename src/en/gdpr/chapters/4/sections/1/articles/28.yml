      {Processing|index:processing} by a {processor|index:processor} shall be governed by a contract or other legal act under Union or Member State law, that is binding on the {processor|index:processor} with regard to the {controller|index:controller} and that sets out the subject-matter and duration of the {processing|index:processing}, the nature and purpose of the {processing|index:processing}, the type of {personal data|index:personal-data} and categories of data subjects and the obligations and rights of the {controller|index:controller}.

Where that other {processor|index:processor} fails to fulfil its data protection obligations, the initial {processor|index:processor} shall remain fully liable to the {controller|index:controller} for the performance of that other processor's obligations.
