      Taking into account the state of the art, the cost of implementation and the
      nature, scope, context and purposes of {processing|index:processing} as well
      as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for rights and freedoms of {natural
      persons|index:natural-person} posed by the {processing|index:processing}, the
      {controller|index:controller} shall, both at the time of the determination of
      the means for {processing|index:processing} and at the time of the {processing|index:processing}
      itself, implement appropriate {technical and organisational measures|index:technical-and-organisational-measures},
      such as {pseudonymisation|index:pseudonymisation}, which are designed to implement
      data-protection principles, such as data minimisation, in an effective manner
      and to integrate the necessary safeguards into the {processing|index:processing}
      in order to meet the requirements of this {Regulation|index:regulation} and
      protect the rights of data subjects.

      The {controller|index:controller} shall implement appropriate {technical and
      organisational measures|index:technical-and-organisational-measures} for ensuring
      that, by default, only {personal data|index:personal-data} which are necessary
      for each specific purpose of the {processing|index:processing} are processed.
      That obligation applies to the amount of {personal data|index:personal-data}
      collected, the extent of their {processing|index:processing}, the period of
      their storage and their accessibility. In particular, such measures shall ensure
      that by default {personal data|index:personal-data} are not made accessible
      without the individual's intervention to an indefinite number of {natural persons|index:natural-person}.
