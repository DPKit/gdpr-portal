          the {controller|index:controller} has implemented appropriate technical
          and organisational protection measures, and those measures were applied
          to the {personal data|index:personal-data} affected by the {personal data|index:personal-data}
          breach, in particular those that render the {personal data|index:personal-data}
          unintelligible to any person who is not authorised to access it, such as
          encryption;

          the {controller|index:controller} has taken subsequent measures which ensure
          that the high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects referred
          to in paragraph 1 is no longer likely to materialise;

          it would involve disproportionate effort. In such a case, there shall instead
          be a public communication or similar measure whereby the data subjects are
          informed in an equally effective manner.
    preamble: >-
      The communication to the {data subject|index:data-subject} referred to in paragraph
      1 shall not be required if any of the following conditions are met:

    content: >-
      If the {controller|index:controller} has not already communicated the {personal
      data|index:personal-data} breach to the {data subject|index:data-subject}, the
      {supervisory authority|index:supervisory-authority}, having considered the likelihood
      of the {personal data|index:personal-data} breach resulting in a high risk,
      may require it to do so or may decide that any of the conditions referred to
      in paragraph 3 are met.
