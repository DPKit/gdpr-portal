      Where a type of {processing|index:processing} in particular using new technologies, and taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the {processing|index:processing}, is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of {natural persons|index:natural-person}, the {controller|index:controller} shall, prior to the {processing|index:processing}, carry out an assessment of the impact of the envisaged {processing|index:processing} operations on the protection of {personal data|index:personal-data}. A single assessment may address a set of similar {processing|index:processing} operations that present similar high risks.
