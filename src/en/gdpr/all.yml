      in respect of {processing|index:processing} activities and to ensure the free
      flow of {personal data|index:personal-data} between Member States.

      The {processing|index:processing} of {personal data|index:personal-data} should
      be designed to serve mankind. The right to the protection of {personal data|index:personal-data}
      is not an absolute right; it must be considered in relation to its function
      in society and be balanced against other fundamental rights, in accordance with
      the principle of proportionality. This {Regulation|index:regulation} respects
      all fundamental rights and observes the freedoms and principles recognised in
      the Charter as enshrined in the Treaties, in particular the respect for private
      and family life, home and communications, the protection of {personal data|index:personal-data},
      freedom of thought, conscience and religion, freedom of expression and information,
      freedom to conduct a business, the right to an effective remedy and to a fair
      trial, and cultural, religious and linguistic diversity.

      The economic and social integration resulting from the functioning of the internal
      market has led to a substantial increase in cross-border flows of {personal
      data|index:personal-data}. The exchange of {personal data|index:personal-data}
      between public and private actors, including {natural persons|index:natural-person},
      associations and undertakings across the Union has increased. National authorities
      in the Member States are being called upon by Union law to cooperate and exchange
      {personal data|index:personal-data} so as to be able to perform their duties
      or carry out tasks on behalf of an authority in another Member State.

      Rapid technological developments and globalisation have brought new challenges
      for the protection of {personal data|index:personal-data}. The scale of the
      collection and sharing of {personal data|index:personal-data} has increased
      significantly. Technology allows both private companies and public authorities
      to make use of {personal data|index:personal-data} on an unprecedented scale
      in order to pursue their activities. {Natural persons|index:natural-person}
      increasingly make personal information available publicly and globally. Technology
      has transformed both the economy and social life, and should further facilitate
      the free flow of {personal data|index:personal-data} within the Union and the
      transfer to third countries and international organisations, while ensuring
      a high level of the protection of {personal data|index:personal-data}.

      Those developments require a strong and more coherent data protection framework
      in the Union, backed by strong enforcement, given the importance of creating
      the trust that will allow the digital economy to develop across the internal

      The objectives and principles of Directive 95/46/EC remain sound, but it has
      not prevented fragmentation in the implementation of data protection across
      the Union, legal uncertainty or a widespread public perception that there are
      significant risks to the protection of {natural persons|index:natural-person},
      in particular with regard to online activity. Differences in the level of protection
      of the rights and freedoms of {natural persons|index:natural-person}, in particular
      the right to the protection of {personal data|index:personal-data}, with regard
      to the {processing|index:processing} of {personal data|index:personal-data}
      in the Member States may prevent the free flow of {personal data|index:personal-data}
      throughout the Union. Those differences may therefore constitute an obstacle
      to the pursuit of economic activities at the level of the Union, distort competition
      and impede authorities in the discharge of their responsibilities under Union
      law. Such a difference in levels of protection is due to the existence of differences
      in the implementation and application of Directive 95/46/EC.

      throughout the Union and to prevent divergences hampering the free movement
      of {personal data|index:personal-data} within the internal market, a {Regulation|index:regulation}
      is necessary to provide legal certainty and transparency for economic operators,

      States and their supervisory authorities, are encouraged to take account of
      the specific needs of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in the application

      The protection of {natural persons|index:natural-person} with regard to the

      authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or
      prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including
      the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security and
      the free movement of such data, is the subject of a specific Union legal act.
      This {Regulation|index:regulation} should not, therefore, apply to {processing|index:processing}
      activities for those purposes. However, {personal data|index:personal-data}
      processed by public authorities under this {Regulation|index:regulation} should,
      when used for those purposes, be governed by a more specific Union legal act,
      namely Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council
      (7). Member States may entrust competent authorities within the meaning of Directive
      (EU) 2016/680 with tasks which are not necessarily carried out for the purposes
      of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences
      or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and
      prevention of threats to public security, so that the {processing|index:processing}
      of {personal data|index:personal-data} for those other purposes, in so far as
      it is within the scope of Union law, falls within the scope of this {Regulation|index:regulation}.
      With regard to the {processing|index:processing} of {personal data|index:personal-data}
      by those competent authorities for purposes falling within scope of this {Regulation|index:regulation},
      Member States should be able to maintain or introduce more specific provisions
      to adapt the application of the rules of this {Regulation|index:regulation}.
      Such provisions may determine more precisely specific requirements for the {processing|index:processing}
      of {personal data|index:personal-data} by those competent authorities for those
      other purposes, taking into account the constitutional, organisational and administrative
      structure of the respective Member State. When the {processing|index:processing}
      of {personal data|index:personal-data} by private bodies falls within the scope
      of this {Regulation|index:regulation}, this {Regulation|index:regulation} should
      provide for the possibility for Member States under specific conditions to restrict
      by law certain obligations and rights when such a restriction constitutes a
      necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard specific
      important interests including public security and the prevention, investigation,
      detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties,
      including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security.
      This is relevant for instance in the framework of anti-money laundering or the
      activities of forensic laboratories.

      {controller|index:controller} for erasure or for a periodic review. Every reasonable
      step should be taken to ensure that {personal data|index:personal-data} which

      The {processing|index:processing} of {personal data|index:personal-data} for
      purposes other than those for which the {personal data|index:personal-data}
      were initially collected should be allowed only where the {processing|index:processing}
      is compatible with the purposes for which the {personal data|index:personal-data}
      were initially collected. In such a case, no legal basis separate from that
      which allowed the collection of the {personal data|index:personal-data} is required.
      If the {processing|index:processing} is necessary for the performance of a task
      carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority
      vested in the {controller|index:controller}, Union or Member State law may determine
      and specify the tasks and purposes for which the further {processing|index:processing}
      should be regarded as compatible and lawful. Further {processing|index:processing}
      for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research
      purposes or statistical purposes should be considered to be compatible lawful
      {processing|index:processing} operations. The legal basis provided by Union
      or Member State law for the {processing|index:processing} of {personal data|index:personal-data}
      may also provide a legal basis for further {processing|index:processing}. In
      order to ascertain whether a purpose of further {processing|index:processing}
      is compatible with the purpose for which the {personal data|index:personal-data}
      are initially collected, the {controller|index:controller}, after having met
      all the requirements for the lawfulness of the original {processing|index:processing},
      should take into account, inter alia: any link between those purposes and the
      purposes of the intended further {processing|index:processing}; the context
      in which the {personal data|index:personal-data} have been collected, in particular
      the reasonable expectations of data subjects based on their relationship with
      the {controller|index:controller} as to their further use; the nature of the
      {personal data|index:personal-data}; the consequences of the intended further
      {processing|index:processing} for data subjects; and the existence of appropriate
      safeguards in both the original and intended further {processing|index:processing}
      operations. Where the {data subject|index:data-subject} has given {consent|index:consent}
      or the {processing|index:processing} is based on Union or Member State law which
      constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to
      safeguard, in particular, important objectives of general public interest, the
      {controller|index:controller} should be allowed to further process the {personal
      data|index:personal-data} irrespective of the compatibility of the purposes.
      In any case, the application of the principles set out in this {Regulation|index:regulation}
      and in particular the information of the {data subject|index:data-subject} on
      those other purposes and on his or her rights including the right to object,
      should be ensured. Indicating possible criminal acts or threats to public security

      data|index:personal-data} in individual cases or in several cases relating to
      the same criminal act or threats to public security to a competent authority
      should be regarded as being in the legitimate interest pursued by the {controller|index:controller}.
      However, such transmission in the legitimate interest of the {controller|index:controller}
      or further {processing|index:processing} of {personal data|index:personal-data}
      should be prohibited if the {processing|index:processing} is not compatible
      with a legal, professional or other binding obligation of secrecy.

      Furthermore, that right should not prejudice the right of the {data subject|index:data-subject}
      to obtain the erasure of {personal data|index:personal-data} and the limitations

      rights and of effective legal remedies, including to obtain effective administrative
      or judicial redress and to claim compensation, in the Union or in a third country.
      They should relate in particular to compliance with the general principles relating

      of data protection by design and by default. Transfers may also be carried out

      including on the basis of provisions to be inserted into administrative arrangements,

      Any natural or legal person has the right to bring an action for annulment of
      decisions of the Board before the Court of Justice under the conditions provided
      for in Article 263 TFEU. As addressees of such decisions, the supervisory authorities
      concerned which wish to challenge them have to bring action within two months
      of being notified of them, in accordance with Article 263 TFEU. Where decisions
      of the Board are of direct and individual concern to a {controller|index:controller},
      {processor|index:processor} or complainant, the latter may bring an action for
      annulment against those decisions within two months of their publication on
      the website of the Board, in accordance with Article 263 TFEU. Without prejudice
      to this right under Article 263 TFEU, each natural or legal person should have
      an effective judicial remedy before the competent national court against a decision
      of a {supervisory authority|index:supervisory-authority} which produces legal
      effects concerning that person. Such a decision concerns in particular the exercise
      of investigative, corrective and authorisation powers by the {supervisory authority|index:supervisory-authority}
      or the dismissal or rejection of complaints. However, the right to an effective
      judicial remedy does not encompass measures taken by supervisory authorities
      which are not legally binding, such as opinions issued by or advice provided
      by the {supervisory authority|index:supervisory-authority}. Proceedings against
      a {supervisory authority|index:supervisory-authority} should be brought before
      the courts of the Member State where the {supervisory authority|index:supervisory-authority}
      is established and should be conducted in accordance with that Member State's
      procedural law. Those courts should exercise full jurisdiction, which should
      include jurisdiction to examine all questions of fact and law relevant to the
      dispute before them. Where a complaint has been rejected or dismissed by a {supervisory
      authority|index:supervisory-authority}, the complainant may bring proceedings
      before the courts in the same Member State. In the context of judicial remedies
      relating to the application of this {Regulation|index:regulation}, national
      courts which consider a decision on the question necessary to enable them to
      give judgment, may, or in the case provided for in Article 267 TFEU, must, request
      the Court of Justice to give a preliminary ruling on the interpretation of Union
      law, including this {Regulation|index:regulation}. Furthermore, where a decision
      of a {supervisory authority|index:supervisory-authority} implementing a decision
      of the Board is challenged before a national court and the validity of the decision
      of the Board is at issue, that national court does not have the power to declare
      the Board's decision invalid but must refer the question of validity to the
      Court of Justice in accordance with Article 267 TFEU as interpreted by the Court
      of Justice, where it considers the decision invalid. However, a national court
      may not refer a question on the validity of the decision of the Board at the
      request of a natural or legal person which had the opportunity to bring an action
      for annulment of that decision, in particular if it was directly and individually
      concerned by that decision, but had not done so within the period laid down
      in Article 263 TFEU.

      of {personal data|index:personal-data} solely for journalistic purposes, or
      for the purposes of academic, artistic or literary expression should be subject
      to derogations or exemptions from certain provisions of this {Regulation|index:regulation}
      if necessary to reconcile the right to the protection of {personal data|index:personal-data}
      with the right to freedom of expression and information, as enshrined in Article
      11 of the Charter. This should apply in particular to the {processing|index:processing}
      of {personal data|index:personal-data} in the audiovisual field and in news
      archives and press libraries. Therefore, Member States should adopt legislative
      measures which lay down the exemptions and derogations necessary for the purpose
      of balancing those fundamental rights. Member States should adopt such exemptions
      and derogations on general principles, the rights of the {data subject|index:data-subject},
      the {controller|index:controller} and the {processor|index:processor}, the transfer
      of {personal data|index:personal-data} to third countries or international organisations,
      the independent supervisory authorities, cooperation and consistency, and specific
      data-{processing|index:processing} situations. Where such exemptions or derogations
      differ from one Member State to another, the law of the Member State to which
      the {controller|index:controller} is subject should apply. In order to take
      account of the importance of the right to freedom of expression in every democratic
      society, it is necessary to interpret notions relating to that freedom, such
      as journalism, broadly.

      This {Regulation|index:regulation} allows the principle of public access to
      official documents to be taken into account when applying this {Regulation|index:regulation}.
      Public access to official documents may be considered to be in the public interest.
      {Personal data|index:personal-data} in documents held by a public authority
      or a public body should be able to be publicly disclosed by that authority or
      body if the disclosure is provided for by Union or Member State law to which
      the public authority or public body is subject. Such laws should reconcile public
      access to official documents and the reuse of public sector information with
      the right to the protection of {personal data|index:personal-data} and may therefore
      provide for the necessary reconciliation with the right to the protection of
      {personal data|index:personal-data} pursuant to this {Regulation|index:regulation}.
      The reference to public authorities and bodies should in that context include
      all authorities or other bodies covered by Member State law on public access
      to documents. Directive 2003/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council
      (14) leaves intact and in no way affects the level of protection of {natural
      persons|index:natural-person} with regard to the {processing|index:processing}
      of {personal data|index:personal-data} under the provisions of Union and Member
      State law, and in particular does not alter the obligations and rights set out
      in this {Regulation|index:regulation}. In particular, that Directive should
      not apply to documents to which access is excluded or restricted by virtue of
      the access regimes on the grounds of protection of {personal data|index:personal-data},
      and parts of documents accessible by virtue of those regimes which contain {personal
      data|index:personal-data} the re-use of which has been provided for by law as
      being incompatible with the law concerning the protection of {natural persons|index:natural-person}
      with regard to the {processing|index:processing} of {personal data|index:personal-data}.

      The {processing|index:processing} of {personal data|index:personal-data} for

      By coupling information from registries, researchers can obtain new knowledge
      of great value with regard to widespread medical conditions such as cardiovascular
      disease, cancer and depression. On the basis of registries, research results
      can be enhanced, as they draw on a larger population. Within social science,
      research on the basis of registries enables researchers to obtain essential
      knowledge about the long-term correlation of a number of social conditions such
      as unemployment and education with other life conditions. Research results obtained
      through registries provide solid, high-quality knowledge which can provide the

      The objectives and principles of Directive 95/46/EC remain sound, but it has
      not prevented fragmentation in the implementation of data protection across
      the Union, legal uncertainty or a widespread public perception that there are
      significant risks to the protection of {natural persons|index:natural-person},
      in particular with regard to online activity. Differences in the level of protection
      of the rights and freedoms of {natural persons|index:natural-person}, in particular
      the right to the protection of {personal data|index:personal-data}, with regard
      to the {processing|index:processing} of {personal data|index:personal-data}
      in the Member States may prevent the free flow of {personal data|index:personal-data}
      throughout the Union. Those differences may therefore constitute an obstacle
      to the pursuit of economic activities at the level of the Union, distort competition
      and impede authorities in the discharge of their responsibilities under Union
      law. Such a difference in levels of protection is due to the existence of differences
      in the implementation and application of Directive 95/46/EC.

      The protection of {natural persons|index:natural-person} with regard to the

      prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including
      the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security and
      the free movement of such data, is the subject of a specific Union legal act.
      This {Regulation|index:regulation} should not, therefore, apply to {processing|index:processing}
      activities for those purposes. However, {personal data|index:personal-data}
      processed by public authorities under this {Regulation|index:regulation} should,
      when used for those purposes, be governed by a more specific Union legal act,
      namely Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council
      (7). Member States may entrust competent authorities within the meaning of Directive
      (EU) 2016/680 with tasks which are not necessarily carried out for the purposes
      of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences
      or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and
      prevention of threats to public security, so that the {processing|index:processing}
      of {personal data|index:personal-data} for those other purposes, in so far as
      it is within the scope of Union law, falls within the scope of this {Regulation|index:regulation}.
      With regard to the {processing|index:processing} of {personal data|index:personal-data}
      by those competent authorities for purposes falling within scope of this {Regulation|index:regulation},
      Member States should be able to maintain or introduce more specific provisions
      to adapt the application of the rules of this {Regulation|index:regulation}.
      Such provisions may determine more precisely specific requirements for the {processing|index:processing}
      of {personal data|index:personal-data} by those competent authorities for those
      other purposes, taking into account the constitutional, organisational and administrative
      structure of the respective Member State. When the {processing|index:processing}
      of {personal data|index:personal-data} by private bodies falls within the scope
      of this {Regulation|index:regulation}, this {Regulation|index:regulation} should
      provide for the possibility for Member States under specific conditions to restrict
      by law certain obligations and rights when such a restriction constitutes a
      necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard specific
      important interests including public security and the prevention, investigation,
      detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties,
      including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security.
      This is relevant for instance in the framework of anti-money laundering or the
      activities of forensic laboratories.

      {Consent|index:consent} should be given by a clear affirmative act establishing
      a freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's
      agreement to the {processing|index:processing} of {personal data|index:personal-data}
      relating to him or her, such as by a written statement, including by electronic
      means, or an oral statement. This could include ticking a box when visiting
      an internet website, choosing technical settings for information society services
      or another statement or conduct which clearly indicates in this context the
      data subject's acceptance of the proposed {processing|index:processing} of his
      or her {personal data|index:personal-data}. Silence, pre-ticked boxes or inactivity
      should not therefore constitute {consent|index:consent}. {Consent|index:consent}
      should cover all {processing|index:processing} activities carried out for the
      same purpose or purposes. When the {processing|index:processing} has multiple
      purposes, {consent|index:consent} should be given for all of them. If the data
      subject's {consent|index:consent} is to be given following a request by electronic
      means, the request must be clear, concise and not unnecessarily disruptive to
      the use of the service for which it is provided.

      The main establishment of a {controller|index:controller} in the Union should

      in the Union, in which case that other establishment should be considered to

      for {processing|index:processing} {personal data|index:personal-data} or {processing|index:processing}

      Any {processing|index:processing} of {personal data|index:personal-data} should
      be lawful and fair. It should be transparent to {natural persons|index:natural-person}
      that {personal data|index:personal-data} concerning them are collected, used,
      consulted or otherwise processed and to what extent the {personal data|index:personal-data}

      and communication relating to the {processing|index:processing} of those {personal
      data|index:personal-data} be easily accessible and easy to understand, and that
      clear and plain language be used. That principle concerns, in particular, information

      the purposes of the {processing|index:processing} and further information to
      ensure fair and transparent {processing|index:processing} in respect of the

      for which {personal data|index:personal-data} are processed should be explicit
      and legitimate and determined at the time of the collection of the {personal
      data|index:personal-data}. The {personal data|index:personal-data} should be
      adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which
      they are processed. This requires, in particular, ensuring that the period for

      minimum. {Personal data|index:personal-data} should be processed only if the
      purpose of the {processing|index:processing} could not reasonably be fulfilled
      by other means. In order to ensure that the {personal data|index:personal-data}
      are not kept longer than necessary, time limits should be established by the
      {controller|index:controller} for erasure or for a periodic review. Every reasonable
      step should be taken to ensure that {personal data|index:personal-data} which
      are inaccurate are rectified or deleted. {Personal data|index:personal-data}
      should be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security and confidentiality
      of the {personal data|index:personal-data}, including for preventing unauthorised

      {processing|index:processing} for data subjects; and the existence of appropriate

      or further {processing|index:processing} of {personal data|index:personal-data}
      should be prohibited if the {processing|index:processing} is not compatible

      In setting detailed rules concerning the format and procedures applicable to

      {personal data|index:personal-data} had been protected by appropriate technical

      Directive 95/46/EC provided for a general obligation to notify the {processing|index:processing}

      operations which substantially affect a significant number of data subjects

      concerned or the Commission requests that such matter should be handled in the
      consistency mechanism. That mechanism should be without prejudice to any measures
      that the Commission may take in the exercise of its powers under the Treaties.

      Any natural or legal person has the right to bring an action for annulment of
      decisions of the Board before the Court of Justice under the conditions provided
      for in Article 263 TFEU. As addressees of such decisions, the supervisory authorities
      concerned which wish to challenge them have to bring action within two months
      of being notified of them, in accordance with Article 263 TFEU. Where decisions
      of the Board are of direct and individual concern to a {controller|index:controller},
      {processor|index:processor} or complainant, the latter may bring an action for
      annulment against those decisions within two months of their publication on
      the website of the Board, in accordance with Article 263 TFEU. Without prejudice
      to this right under Article 263 TFEU, each natural or legal person should have
      an effective judicial remedy before the competent national court against a decision
      of a {supervisory authority|index:supervisory-authority} which produces legal
      effects concerning that person. Such a decision concerns in particular the exercise
      of investigative, corrective and authorisation powers by the {supervisory authority|index:supervisory-authority}
      or the dismissal or rejection of complaints. However, the right to an effective
      judicial remedy does not encompass measures taken by supervisory authorities
      which are not legally binding, such as opinions issued by or advice provided
      by the {supervisory authority|index:supervisory-authority}. Proceedings against
      a {supervisory authority|index:supervisory-authority} should be brought before
      the courts of the Member State where the {supervisory authority|index:supervisory-authority}
      is established and should be conducted in accordance with that Member State's
      procedural law. Those courts should exercise full jurisdiction, which should
      include jurisdiction to examine all questions of fact and law relevant to the
      dispute before them. Where a complaint has been rejected or dismissed by a {supervisory
      authority|index:supervisory-authority}, the complainant may bring proceedings
      before the courts in the same Member State. In the context of judicial remedies
      relating to the application of this {Regulation|index:regulation}, national
      courts which consider a decision on the question necessary to enable them to
      give judgment, may, or in the case provided for in Article 267 TFEU, must, request
      the Court of Justice to give a preliminary ruling on the interpretation of Union
      law, including this {Regulation|index:regulation}. Furthermore, where a decision
      of a {supervisory authority|index:supervisory-authority} implementing a decision
      of the Board is challenged before a national court and the validity of the decision
      of the Board is at issue, that national court does not have the power to declare
      the Board's decision invalid but must refer the question of validity to the
      Court of Justice in accordance with Article 267 TFEU as interpreted by the Court
      of Justice, where it considers the decision invalid. However, a national court
      may not refer a question on the validity of the decision of the Board at the
      request of a natural or legal person which had the opportunity to bring an action
      for annulment of that decision, in particular if it was directly and individually
      concerned by that decision, but had not done so within the period laid down
      in Article 263 TFEU.

      In order to strengthen and harmonise administrative penalties for infringements

      should have the power to impose administrative fines. This {Regulation|index:regulation}

      related administrative fines, which should be determined by the competent {supervisory

      account all relevant circumstances of the specific situation, with due regard

      its consequences and the measures taken to ensure compliance with the obligations
      under this {Regulation|index:regulation} and to prevent or mitigate the consequences
      of the infringement. Where administrative fines are imposed on an undertaking,
      an undertaking should be understood to be an undertaking in accordance with

      imposed on persons that are not an undertaking, the {supervisory authority|index:supervisory-authority}

      of {personal data|index:personal-data} to third countries or international organisations,

      This {Regulation|index:regulation} allows the principle of public access to
      official documents to be taken into account when applying this {Regulation|index:regulation}.
      Public access to official documents may be considered to be in the public interest.
      {Personal data|index:personal-data} in documents held by a public authority
      or a public body should be able to be publicly disclosed by that authority or
      body if the disclosure is provided for by Union or Member State law to which
      the public authority or public body is subject. Such laws should reconcile public
      access to official documents and the reuse of public sector information with
      the right to the protection of {personal data|index:personal-data} and may therefore
      provide for the necessary reconciliation with the right to the protection of
      {personal data|index:personal-data} pursuant to this {Regulation|index:regulation}.
      The reference to public authorities and bodies should in that context include
      all authorities or other bodies covered by Member State law on public access
      to documents. Directive 2003/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council

      The {processing|index:processing} of {personal data|index:personal-data} for
      archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research
      purposes or statistical purposes should be subject to appropriate safeguards
      for the rights and freedoms of the {data subject|index:data-subject} pursuant

      data which do not permit or no longer permit the identification of data subjects,
      provided that appropriate safeguards exist (such as, for instance, {pseudonymisation|index:pseudonymisation}
      of the data). Member States should provide for appropriate safeguards for the
      {processing|index:processing} of {personal data|index:personal-data} for archiving
      purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes
      or statistical purposes. Member States should be authorised to provide, under

      specifications and derogations with regard to the information requirements and
      rights to rectification, to erasure, to be forgotten, to {restriction of processing|index:restriction-of-processing},

      By coupling information from registries, researchers can obtain new knowledge
      of great value with regard to widespread medical conditions such as cardiovascular
      disease, cancer and depression. On the basis of registries, research results
      can be enhanced, as they draw on a larger population. Within social science,
      research on the basis of registries enables researchers to obtain essential
      knowledge about the long-term correlation of a number of social conditions such
      as unemployment and education with other life conditions. Research results obtained
      through registries provide solid, high-quality knowledge which can provide the
      basis for the formulation and implementation of knowledge-based policy, improve
      the quality of life for a number of people and improve the efficiency of social
      services. In order to facilitate scientific research, {personal data|index:personal-data}
      can be processed for scientific research purposes, subject to appropriate conditions
      and safeguards set out in Union or Member State law.
